      <title>Leading Indian news agency becomes victim of cyberterrorism</title>

      <description>&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://ians.in/&#34;&gt;Indo-Asian News Service (IANS)&lt;/a&gt; is one of India&#39;s leading news wires. Their news is available to subscribers only and among their clients are various newspapers and news websites. They are one of the fastest text news services and often among the first to break news.

Last night, their website was hacked (or to be politically correct I should say defaced or owned) allegedly by hackers based at Pakistan. These criminals did not take down the entire website, it was worse. They put in derogatory stories against India within the wire. To news websites syndicating their news, it would seem like a genuine news from their end. Here is a screenshot of their latest post today morning.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/haxored.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ians Hacked&#34; width=&#34;221&#34; height=&#34;384&#34; /&gt;

At the time of writing (Feb 11th 10am or 8:30 Indian time) the IANS website is still unaccessible

Some observations about IANS
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It uses PHP&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The client side coding is very pathetically done, Very likely the backend is just as bad or worse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Their servers(at Delhi) uses &#34;TATA Communications&#34; as ISP meaning it is either self hosted or at a datacenter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;Uses windows for webservers (This is AFAIK, website is down now, so cant probe to be sure) &lt;/span&gt;correction it is on Red Hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
What ticks me off is that this is such an important site it should be much more secure. The traffic to the site may be negligable, but if at all you are a newsjunkie, it is highly likely that you read stories from IANS on a daily basis on other websites/newspapers.

Edit : 9am IST the website is back online

UPDATE : &lt;strong&gt;4:05 pm (Indian Time)&lt;/strong&gt; IANS has published the following message on their wire :-
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Subscriber,
The IANS website -- www.ians.in -- was targeted by Pakistani hackers last night.

The hackers gained entry into the site and began uploading abusive

content. This was noticed around 1 a.m. by our technical staff, who

immediately began clearing the offensive content. To prevent any damage to

the database, the site was shut down for a few hours. Meanwhile, we are

further strengthening our security systems to prevent the recurrence, as far

as possible, of any such incidents in the future.

Any inconvenience caused to subscribers is deeply regretted.

Best regards,

Partha Sarathi Mitra

C.T.O.

IANS&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some things worth noting:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There appears to be 2 attacks not 1, one around midnight-ish and one few hours later. Messages from the first attack was deleted, service resumed normally, then there was another attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If site was intentionally shut down then why no message on it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cant seem to find any reassurances that our contact details, etc are safe... Did they steal anything?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No email communication from them yet. This message was just put into the wire along with 100s of stories, very easy to miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Secrets of Google News...What I learnt the hard way!</title>

      <description>Just now I noticed an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/016773.html&#34;&gt;interesting post from seroundtable&lt;/a&gt; on my feed-reader and it immediately caught my attention. Nice to hear things &lt;a href=&#34;http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/psstsecrets-of-google-news-exposed.html&#34;&gt;directly from the horses mouth&lt;/a&gt;, most of them are what I assumed. searchengineland also posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://searchengineland.com/080403-083445.php&#34;&gt;some comments&lt;/a&gt; on this issue.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having an image next to your article improves your ranking: MYTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Having an image in an article might not improve your ranking, but it is a very important aspect for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/seo-and-newsgooglecom-run-your-own-news-website.html&#34; title=&#34;SEO and news.google.com - Run your own news website&#34;&gt;Google News Publisher&lt;/a&gt;. Say if you are reporting on a story which has many sources, you stand to get greater exposure in case the image from your site is picked up for this story. Once, a story I had about &#34;Britney Spears&#34; had an image of her. Now the news story which showed up on organic SERPs for &#34;Britney Spears&#34; had the image from my site. Got shit loads of traffic on it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updating an article after posting it will create problems with Google News: TRUE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Google said it would re-crawl the articles for updates in the future. This is good for me as some websites (including a popular English newspaper in Thailand) simply remove most stories after a couple of days of publishing and they still show up in the Google News search. This sux. They would be un-indexed if Google started to re-crawl news stories.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timing the publication of your article improves your article ranking: MYTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don&#39;t necessarily agree. It may not affect the ranking, but would definitely affect the traffic. Well Google does give some storyrank based on the freshness of the story. If my major target were the Americans, and I post a story during morning(Thai time), the story might get lost/replaced by fresher stories by the time the Americans wake up. &amp;lt;-- This is something I haven&#39;t researched a lot, but my common sense says so.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Articles that are just images or video won&#39;t be included: TRUE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Agree 100%
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&#39;s no way to see why my articles weren&#39;t included in Google News: MYTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As the Google&#39;s blog post says, the web master tools does an excellent job in finding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/google-works-in-mysterious-ways-stops-crawling.html&#34; title=&#34;Google works in mysterious ways - Stops Crawling&#34;&gt;potential issues&lt;/a&gt; with the crawling your site.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publishing a sitemap helps my rankings: MYTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But... it does help Google find new stories. or a story which they might have missed on the website.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redesigning my site may affect my coverage in Google News: TRUE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
AFAIK this should not be such an issue. I launched a new section on an entirely different &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/tag/cms&#34;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; and from the first minute Google has had no issues in crawling the content. I even make tweaks in the template here and there and they don&#39;t have problems. I think the problem occurs if your layout is crappy with lots of junk in it. But for most properly done sites it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I put AdSense on my site, my article rankings will improve: MYTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We have faith in Google. Even if the Google blog said this were true I wouldn&#39;t believe it ;)
