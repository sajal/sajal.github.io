      <title>truewifi.net == big FAIL for usability</title>

      <description>Today I got myself a true wifi package for 500 Baht/month. Its quite nice as our new office doesn&#39;t have a fixed line yet... and true wifi&#39;s signal reaches here....

I logged in to truewifi.net today to change my password, and found that everything is in Thai, that&#39;s not bad as Thai people prefer reading in Thai. I looked around, couldn&#39;t find a language switch until i found this in the top right corner.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sajalkayan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/true.png&#34; title=&#34;truewifi.net&#34; rel=&#34;lightbox&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.sajalkayan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/true_th.png&#34; alt=&#34;true wifi&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(click image above for full screen shot)

Guessed it was for language switching based on the words in the url... Im sure an average English speaking internet user wouldn&#39;t be able to figure this out.

My question to True is &lt;strong&gt;Why have an English version when only the Thai readers would be able to access it?&lt;/strong&gt; or does True want to show the English version only to the Thai readers to &lt;strong&gt;show off&lt;/strong&gt;. They didnt think anyone would actually &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to use it.

The good part is they don&#39;t have any blinking things on it yet.
