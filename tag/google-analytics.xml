      <description>Today, I was looking into web performance issues for a new client who wishes to remain anonymous and saw an interesting example of value provided by improving performance.

One of the first things I do when looking into a new site is look at Google Analytics to understand a little about the sites visitors. This helps in prioritizing changes which affects the majority of users.

An interesting observation :-

&lt;strong&gt;Pageviews for all visitors&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://i.ticdn.com/sajal/page-views.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Pageviews for all visitors&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.ticdn.com/sajal/page-views-s.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pageviews for all visitors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Average Pageviews for all visitors&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://i.ticdn.com/sajal/avg-page-views.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Average Pageviews for all visitors&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.ticdn.com/sajal/avg-page-views-s.png&#34; alt=&#34;Average Pageviews for all visitors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Adsense revenue also followed a similar path. -- Screenshot not available

The reason for this effect was a simple database indexing tweak which sped up the backend performance of a very important action page on the site.

The site in question is a web application where user inputs something and gets some result. It is not a content site where pageview/user could have increased due to some interesting content being added or something. The only change was indexing of a column which should have an index right from the start.

&lt;em&gt;DISCLAIMER: I did not have any role in the above improvement. This was done before my involvement. Perhaps this convinced the client to hire me. Screenshots/info shared with clients permission.&lt;/em&gt;
