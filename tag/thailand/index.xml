      <title>BarCampBKK3 - my experience!</title>

      <description>Last weekend(23rd and 24th May) I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BarCamp Bangkok 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was an awesome experience... In this blogpost i intend to outline some of the interesting aspects of it from my viewpoint.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/newdavich/3557413836/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3652/3557413836_397383f4d8_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Barcampbkk3 sign board&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(Photo Credit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/newdavich/&#34;&gt;new_davich&lt;/a&gt; on flickr)

Firstly over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/whos-coming&#34;&gt;700 people registered on the Barcamp Website&lt;/a&gt;. Atleast &lt;strong&gt;550&lt;/strong&gt; people showed up at the actual event. That is 550 people registered at the registration desks on Day 1. There may have been more people turning up throughout the day who didn&#39;t register and I don&#39;t yet have the figure for Day 2. This IMHO would make &lt;strong&gt;BarCampbkk3 the biggest BarCamp in ASEAN&lt;/strong&gt;. There were many people who flew in to Bangkok from overseas exclusively for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/tag/barcamp&#34;&gt;BarCamp&lt;/a&gt; from countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam and Hong Kong. Many to Bangkok for their first time.

Many thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spu.ac.th/english/index_eng.html&#34;&gt;Sripatum University(SPU)&lt;/a&gt; for agreeing to be the venue. They were very helpful and even provided us with 20 to 30 volunteers to help with the arrangements.

&lt;strong&gt;Tech start-ups in Thailand&lt;/strong&gt;

Among the interesting topics covered were some presentations and a discussion relating to Start-ups in Thailand. There were talks focused on financing issues and other issues faced by startups. The most common factors discouraging Thais and Foreigners from setting up a start-up in Thailand is(IMHO) the procedure and red-tape involved in setting up and managing a Thai Company. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnberns.com/&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; mentioned about a friend who flew to Singapore in a morning and by afternoon he had his company set-up and ready for business. So thats about 10,000 Baht for the airfare and about S$200 to S$300(about 4,700 to 7,100 Thai Baht) for formalities, etc. Here in Thailand even if you know exactly what to do, it would take weeks.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/proteusguy&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://proteus-tech.com/&#34;&gt;Proteus Tech&lt;/a&gt; gave and interesting talk titled &#34;How to Create a Successful Technical Startup&#34;. Proteus Tech is also interested to encourage the potential Thai entrepreneurs. Proteus Tech said in a statement:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;We hope to organize a startup event to help people understand how to write a business plan and define a business strategy. Then we&#39;ll have a follow up &#34;startup gauntlet&#34; where we give them a chance to present their biz plan and get evaluated + win some seed capital to start.&#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ben&#39;s Presentation - Why didn&#39;t I see this a few years ago, I learned some of the points the hard way.

&lt;strong&gt;Overnight Activities&lt;/strong&gt;

This was the first Barcamp in Thailand where we stayed at the venue overnight. The evening started with drinks at a nearby pub, after which we returned back to the venue. I tried in vain to help people getstated in Linux, but looks like nobody was interested... We played a couple of rounds of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html&#34;&gt;Werewolf Game&lt;/a&gt; which was interesting, the foreigners always got nominated to be werewolves and kicked out first.... &lt;a href=&#34;http://murz.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;@murz&lt;/a&gt; (tried to) introduce us to a board game &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamecabinet.com/sumo/Issue2/AdelVerpflichtet.html&#34;&gt;Adel Verpflichtet&lt;/a&gt;&#34;. The rules were so complex that she had to draw a flowchart to explain it :)

Along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lopsta.com/&#34;&gt;Jan&lt;/a&gt;, I did a &#34;&lt;strong&gt;SEO site clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&#34; where we analyzed volunteers websites from an SEO viewpoint. Unlike last BarCamp, this was attended by very few people, probably due to clash in timing with other more popular topics.

&lt;strong&gt;Overall it was very exciting to be a part of BarCampBKK3 looking forward to BarCampBKK4&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>BarCampChiangMai - Only one week to go!</title>
      <link>https://www.sajalkayan.com/barcampchiangmai-only-one-week-to-go.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.sajalkayan.com/barcampchiangmai-only-one-week-to-go.html</guid>
      <description>This coming Saturday the geeks of Thailand are gonna congregate at Chiang Mai for the very first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampchiangmai.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BarCamp at Chiang Mai&lt;/a&gt;. In fact May 2008 is the month for camping (ignore the heat and rain, geeks camp in Air Conditioned rooms). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/tag/barcampchiangmai&#34;&gt;BarCampChiangMai&lt;/a&gt; on 17th May, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/drupalcamp-overview&#34;&gt;DrupalCamp&lt;/a&gt; Bangkok on 24th May both of which I intend to attend and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampchiangmai.org/users/view/22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;probably speak&lt;/a&gt; at if I manage to hack up something worth presenting about.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.barcampchiangmai.org/img/logo_web.gif&#34; alt=&#34;BarCampChiangMai logo&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; vspace=&#34;10&#34; width=&#34;396&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/barcampbangkok-winter-2008-a-huge-success.html&#34; title=&#34;BarCampBangkok winter 2008 a HUGE success!&#34;&gt;HUGE success at BarCampBangkok&lt;/a&gt; has shown the Thai geeks the need for more such events. In fact some of the attendees of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/tag/barcampbangkok&#34;&gt;BarCampBangkok&lt;/a&gt; have been organizing a monthly &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.google.com/group/barcampbangkok4ever&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BarcampBangkok4Ever&lt;/a&gt; which is a smaller casual gathering of geeks at a coffee shop.

FYI
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;em&gt;BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences — open, participatory workshop-events, whose content is provided by participants — often focusing on early-stage web applications, and related open source technologies, social protocols, and open data formats. The event will be bilingual, in both English and Thai.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no audience, only participants. All participants should give a demo, a session, photos, videos or anything else. All presentation are scheduled immediately before the event by reserving slots at the venue.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Anyone with something to contribute is welcome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The BarCamp at Chiang Mai would be organized on May 17, 2008 from 1000-1800 hrs at Payap University and is sponsored by Payap University, Codegent and Creative Hacker. With one more week to go &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampchiangmai.org/users/registrants/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;59 people have registered&lt;/a&gt; to participate. I would be staying the night of 17th at Chiang Mai and am &lt;strong&gt;looking for a roomie&lt;/strong&gt; for the night to share the room expense. In case anyone is interested please leave a comment.

      <title>truewifi.net == big FAIL for usability</title>
      <link>https://www.sajalkayan.com/truewifinet-big-fail-for-usability.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2008 10:44:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.sajalkayan.com/truewifinet-big-fail-for-usability.html</guid>
      <description>Today I got myself a true wifi package for 500 Baht/month. Its quite nice as our new office doesn&#39;t have a fixed line yet... and true wifi&#39;s signal reaches here....

I logged in to truewifi.net today to change my password, and found that everything is in Thai, that&#39;s not bad as Thai people prefer reading in Thai. I looked around, couldn&#39;t find a language switch until i found this in the top right corner.

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/true.png&#34; title=&#34;truewifi.net&#34; rel=&#34;lightbox&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.sajalkayan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/true_th.png&#34; alt=&#34;true wifi&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(click image above for full screen shot)

Guessed it was for language switching based on the words in the url... Im sure an average English speaking internet user wouldn&#39;t be able to figure this out.

My question to True is &lt;strong&gt;Why have an English version when only the Thai readers would be able to access it?&lt;/strong&gt; or does True want to show the English version only to the Thai readers to &lt;strong&gt;show off&lt;/strong&gt;. They didnt think anyone would actually &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to use it.

The good part is they don&#39;t have any blinking things on it yet.

      <title>IIFA in Bangkok?</title>
      <link>https://www.sajalkayan.com/iifa-in-bangkok.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2008 15:08:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.sajalkayan.com/iifa-in-bangkok.html</guid>
      <description>w00t w00t w00t!!!!

Got some inside scoop today that there is a high probability of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thaindian.com/bollywood/90-chance-iifa-2008-to-be-held-in-bangkok-says-jogani-4651.html&#34; title=&#34;IIFA at Bangkok in Thailand?&#34;&gt;IIFA awards for 2008 would be held in Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. This is great news for us Indians in Bangkok....

For the uninnitiated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The awards of the International Indian Film Academy (commonly known as the IIFA Awards) is a prestigious award ceremony, honouring Hindi movies (Bollywood) around the world. In the past, IIFA awards have been hosted at Yorkshire, Dubai, Amsterdam, Singapore, Johannesburg, Genting Highlands, Sun City and London.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ive even started fantasizing which stars im gonna see, who can i meet, and most importantly who can I photograph.

This event is bigger than me taking photos. It is great for many things...&lt;!--more--&gt;

1) &lt;strong&gt;Tourism&lt;/strong&gt;. : India is now a significant market for the Thai tourism industry. With all the stars and the media in Thailand, it would be a major boost for the Thai tourism sector. Just imagine how many people would be traveling on their own expense from India and nearby South East Asian countries.

2) A nice opportunity for the Thais to know more about Bollywood movies. Its not just boys and girls running around trees anymore. There is more to it...

3) &lt;strong&gt;Diplomacy?&lt;/strong&gt; : This event would bring Thais and Indians closer together... perhaps finally seal the FTA deal which has been forever under negotiation.

Many more reasons which cant come to my mind right now due to the excitement of the possibility of IIFA being hosted at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chalothailand.com/bangkok&#34;&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Why cant FOSS succeed in India?</title>
      <link>https://www.sajalkayan.com/why-cant-foss-succeed-in-india.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2008 20:29:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.sajalkayan.com/why-cant-foss-succeed-in-india.html</guid>
      <description>Recently Julie posted an interesting article called &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goeastyoungwoman.wordpress.com/2008/02/17/open-source-development-women-and-asians-last/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;open source development: women and Asians last&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#34;. This attributes the main reason for Women and Asian people&#39;s lesser involvement in Open Source development to be its confrontational nature. It does make sense to an extent as far as Thailand is concerned, Thai people generally try to avoid confrontations. Women on the other hand is a species I can never understand.

IMHO, the main issue is software piracy. The uninformed tend to think that &lt;strong&gt;Free Software == Cheap Software&lt;/strong&gt;. Cheap as in low quality. Proprietary software comes at a big price tag, so it must be good? A couple of months ago I visited a lawyer in Thailand and i booted my notebook(loaded with Fedora 7) to show him something. This person immediately remarked &#34;&lt;em&gt;Is that Vista?&lt;/em&gt;&#34; I told him &#34;&lt;em&gt;NO, Its Linux&lt;/em&gt;.&#34;. He found it hard to digest that I was running a far superior GUI than his crappy XP and it was Free. He replied &#34;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isint Linux same like DOS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#34;. This person in question is quite computer literate, did his Masters in the States, manages his own website which by the way runs on an open source script uses open source PHP and MYSQL software and is probably hosted on a server running open source Linux. These people are so into the marketing BS coming from software vendors that they &lt;strong&gt;outright reject &lt;em&gt;Free Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Let me share a personal story. While I was studying at Darjeeling in India, we used to have 3 months long winter vacations with nothing much to do. I decided to investigate what this Linux hype is all about. Picked up a book on Red Hat which came with a FREE CD of the OS (download was out of the question on crappy and expensive dial-up connections). Tried installing Red Hat, installation(step by step from the book) was smooth (and easier) however, on booting, I just couldn&#39;t get the GUI up and running. There was some compatibility issues with the graphics adapter. (No GUI)==(noob cant connect to the net to get help). Asked around, even the techie who set-up our PC, the computer shop, nobody had even heard of Linux. The techie always moved around armed with a CD case full of pirated CDs of Windows, Office and all kinds of bloatwares. He had also memorized the CD keys by now. So... No one to help me out with the Linux issues, except for the internet. I logged on to the net from a friends place, checked on the forums for help, made some trips from forum discussions at a friends place and my home, tried some stuff, but in vein. Finally found one person who could get my PC booted, but unfortunately he lived in Delhi(I was in &lt;strike&gt;Calcutta&lt;/strike&gt; Kolkata) and wanted a return train ticket from Delhi to Calcutta as the fee :D . Finally I gave up on Linux and loaded up Windows again. Led to next few years of being a miserable windows user, even proceeded onto visual basic development and later into .NET. Had I found someone to help me out all those years ago, with all the free time in hand I could have become a Linux Ninja and probably contributed something back to the community. I am a Linux user now, but have been one for only the last couple of years, that too now I don&#39;t have time to code or learn a lot of new stuff.

Now, had software piracy not been so prevalent in India, a lot of people would have to start using Linux out of necessary, the techie would at least have been able to solve my issue and the Linux community would have probably got one more minion on their side.

I am sure such kinds of stories are not rare in a country like India. Another issue in India is poverty. Most schools and colleges charge a very reasonable fee and thus their computer labs are probably funded by Microsoft who make sure their proprietary software is the only software the kids would have an exposure to. They learn to use this platform, grow up on it, become a yet another MS developer working for some HUGE company for peanuts and get consumed in the Rat Race.

Most of the Open Source development is done by hobbyists. In India a coder would need to work overtime to put food on the table, there is no time left for hobbies, probably at the end of the day the sight of a computer might disgust some. There are also some open source development which comes out of professional interests, as per me &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asterisk.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; would be a classic example. A lot of Asterisk development is going on in India due to the shear demand of cheap and reliable VOIP solutions for the Call Centers and BPOs. But what about other areas?

Even the a big news wire website of India use Microsoft&#39;s servers with &lt;strong&gt;ASP platform&lt;/strong&gt;(they probably paid &amp;gt; $10,000 for the horrible custom CMS) to serve their pages and it was &lt;strong&gt;down for 2 days&lt;/strong&gt; leaving news websites and newspapers deprived of news articles. &lt;strong&gt;Try selling an open source content management system to them!&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is that the NON-ACCEPTABILITY of Open Source Solutions in the business world is the main reason for less action in Asia.&lt;/strong&gt; This has to change first!

Do note that I may have exaggerated a little to make my points, I know for a fact that in the last few years &lt;strong&gt;India is coming up on the Open Source radar&lt;/strong&gt;.

See what happens when you use windows for public machines! I was strolling inside the Suvarnabhumi Airport and saw this error message on all international calling kiosks!

BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences — open, participatory workshop-events, whose content is provided by participants — often focusing on early-stage web applications, and related open source technologies, social protocols, and open data formats. The event will be bilingual, in both English and Thai.

      <description>A little excited about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BarCamp Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. Never participated in any in-the-flesh Geek meet. In touch with JFXBurns and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sugree.com/&#34; title=&#34;Sugree&#39;s Blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sugree&lt;/a&gt; who are working hard behind the scene and proposed &lt;a href=&#34;http://sugree.com/node/19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Indus as a possible venue&lt;/a&gt; for the event. The date has been (kinda) finalized for 26th January (Also India&#39;s Republic Day ).

So same day about one month from now, Ill have many things to do. Attend flag hoisting at the embassy, Spend a lot of time at Queen Sirikit National Convention Center ( India Education Fair on 26th and 27th Jan, Thaindian.com has a booth there &lt;em&gt;visit us&lt;/em&gt; ), and also attend the BarCamp to which I look forward to. My only worry is whether they will allow me to enter the BarCamp dressed in formals ;-)
