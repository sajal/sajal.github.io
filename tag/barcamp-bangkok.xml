      <description>Last weekend(23rd and 24th May) I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BarCamp Bangkok 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was an awesome experience... In this blogpost i intend to outline some of the interesting aspects of it from my viewpoint.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/newdavich/3557413836/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3652/3557413836_397383f4d8_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Barcampbkk3 sign board&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(Photo Credit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/newdavich/&#34;&gt;new_davich&lt;/a&gt; on flickr)

Firstly over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/whos-coming&#34;&gt;700 people registered on the Barcamp Website&lt;/a&gt;. Atleast &lt;strong&gt;550&lt;/strong&gt; people showed up at the actual event. That is 550 people registered at the registration desks on Day 1. There may have been more people turning up throughout the day who didn&#39;t register and I don&#39;t yet have the figure for Day 2. This IMHO would make &lt;strong&gt;BarCampbkk3 the biggest BarCamp in ASEAN&lt;/strong&gt;. There were many people who flew in to Bangkok from overseas exclusively for the &lt;a href=&#34;/tag/barcamp&#34;&gt;BarCamp&lt;/a&gt; from countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam and Hong Kong. Many to Bangkok for their first time.

Many thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spu.ac.th/english/index_eng.html&#34;&gt;Sripatum University(SPU)&lt;/a&gt; for agreeing to be the venue. They were very helpful and even provided us with 20 to 30 volunteers to help with the arrangements.

&lt;strong&gt;Tech start-ups in Thailand&lt;/strong&gt;

Among the interesting topics covered were some presentations and a discussion relating to Start-ups in Thailand. There were talks focused on financing issues and other issues faced by startups. The most common factors discouraging Thais and Foreigners from setting up a start-up in Thailand is(IMHO) the procedure and red-tape involved in setting up and managing a Thai Company. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnberns.com/&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; mentioned about a friend who flew to Singapore in a morning and by afternoon he had his company set-up and ready for business. So thats about 10,000 Baht for the airfare and about S$200 to S$300(about 4,700 to 7,100 Thai Baht) for formalities, etc. Here in Thailand even if you know exactly what to do, it would take weeks.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/proteusguy&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://proteus-tech.com/&#34;&gt;Proteus Tech&lt;/a&gt; gave and interesting talk titled &#34;How to Create a Successful Technical Startup&#34;. Proteus Tech is also interested to encourage the potential Thai entrepreneurs. Proteus Tech said in a statement:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;We hope to organize a startup event to help people understand how to write a business plan and define a business strategy. Then we&#39;ll have a follow up &#34;startup gauntlet&#34; where we give them a chance to present their biz plan and get evaluated + win some seed capital to start.&#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ben&#39;s Presentation - Why didn&#39;t I see this a few years ago, I learned some of the points the hard way.

&lt;strong&gt;Overnight Activities&lt;/strong&gt;

This was the first Barcamp in Thailand where we stayed at the venue overnight. The evening started with drinks at a nearby pub, after which we returned back to the venue. I tried in vain to help people getstated in Linux, but looks like nobody was interested... We played a couple of rounds of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html&#34;&gt;Werewolf Game&lt;/a&gt; which was interesting, the foreigners always got nominated to be werewolves and kicked out first.... &lt;a href=&#34;http://murz.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;@murz&lt;/a&gt; (tried to) introduce us to a board game &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamecabinet.com/sumo/Issue2/AdelVerpflichtet.html&#34;&gt;Adel Verpflichtet&lt;/a&gt;&#34;. The rules were so complex that she had to draw a flowchart to explain it :)

Along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lopsta.com/&#34;&gt;Jan&lt;/a&gt;, I did a &#34;&lt;strong&gt;SEO site clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&#34; where we analyzed volunteers websites from an SEO viewpoint. Unlike last BarCamp, this was attended by very few people, probably due to clash in timing with other more popular topics.

&lt;strong&gt;Overall it was very exciting to be a part of BarCampBKK3 looking forward to BarCampBKK4&lt;/strong&gt;

      <description>Last Saturday was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/&#34; title=&#34;BarCamp Bangkok&#34;&gt;BarCampBangkok&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first BarCamp in Thailand and was hosted at Indus Restaurant.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2219709427/&#34; title=&#34;Banner by sajal kayan, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2059/2219709427_cd416251f3_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Banner&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;161&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The day was January 26th and co-incided with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/sets/72157603799941456/&#34; title=&#34;India&#39;s 59th Republc Day celebrated at Bangkok&#34;&gt;India&#39;s 59th Republic Day&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thaindian.com/news-snippet/international-education-fair-2008-and-premier-schools-exhibition-opens.-4571.html&#34; title=&#34;International Education Fair 2008 and Premier Schools Exhibition Opens&#34;&gt;education exhibition at Queen Sirikit National Convention Center&lt;/a&gt;. Thaindian.com was the Web Partner for the education exhibition and we had 2 booths there, thus my presence there especially during the opening ceremony was important.

After the opening of the exhibition and getting someone to cover for me, at about 11am I headed to BarCamp. As soon as i stepped into the garden I was amazed to see so many happy campers. Registered and got my tag. In case anyone is wondering my tags were &#34;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/tag/drupal&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;/category/seo&#34; title=&#34;SEO articles by Sajal&#34;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt;, SEM and monetizing&lt;/strong&gt;&#34;. Most of my time there I spend interacting with some of the other campers. Did an occasional errand or two.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2220495534/&#34; title=&#34;jfxberns : successfully converted me... by sajal kayan, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2049/2220495534_30a9c3ce34_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jfxberns : successfully converted me...&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;161&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When I entered most of the presentations were either topics I am not interested in or were in Thai language. The ones I was interested in were scheduled after lunch. I was thinking about talking about my journey from Joomla to Drupal, but I had no time(or energy) to prepare anything. After the delicious lunch, I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnberns.com/&#34; title=&#34;John Berns&#34;&gt;jfxbern&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnberns.com/2008/01/27/barcamp-bangkok-wrap-up/&#34; title=&#34;Barcamp Bangkok Wrap-Up from Jon Berns&#34;&gt;Drupal App Development with CCK and Views&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately mid-way during the session his Firefox crashed (it was running on Windoze after all!). The good side was I won a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2221137392/&#34; title=&#34;Google shirt&#34;&gt;cool Google shirt&lt;/a&gt;.

At about 3pm, I left back for Queen Sirikit National Convention center to attend to my booth and take some more pics of the exhibition.Joined back for the afterparty at about 6:30pm. The after-party was fun, so many campers in a nice lil place on Sukhumvit Soi 33/1. Here I was one of the last few people standing.. Next day woke up at 8am to attend to my booths.

BarCampBangkok 2.0 is most likely to be BeachCamp, really looking forward to it. Perhaps use a long weekend and extend it into a 2/3 day event.

      <title>BarCamp to be held in Bangkok</title>
      <link>http://sajal.github.io/barcamp-to-be-held-in-bangkok.html</link>

      <guid>http://sajal.github.io/barcamp-to-be-held-in-bangkok.html</guid>
      <description>A little excited about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BarCamp Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. Never participated in any in-the-flesh Geek meet. In touch with JFXBurns and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sugree.com/&#34; title=&#34;Sugree&#39;s Blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sugree&lt;/a&gt; who are working hard behind the scene and proposed &lt;a href=&#34;http://sugree.com/node/19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Indus as a possible venue&lt;/a&gt; for the event. The date has been (kinda) finalized for 26th January (Also India&#39;s Republic Day ).

So same day about one month from now, Ill have many things to do. Attend flag hoisting at the embassy, Spend a lot of time at Queen Sirikit National Convention Center ( India Education Fair on 26th and 27th Jan, Thaindian.com has a booth there &lt;em&gt;visit us&lt;/em&gt; ), and also attend the BarCamp to which I look forward to. My only worry is whether they will allow me to enter the BarCamp dressed in formals ;-)
