      <description>Last Saturday was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barcampbangkok.org/&#34; title=&#34;BarCamp Bangkok&#34;&gt;BarCampBangkok&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first BarCamp in Thailand and was hosted at Indus Restaurant.

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2219709427/&#34; title=&#34;Banner by sajal kayan, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2059/2219709427_cd416251f3_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Banner&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;161&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The day was January 26th and co-incided with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/sets/72157603799941456/&#34; title=&#34;India&#39;s 59th Republc Day celebrated at Bangkok&#34;&gt;India&#39;s 59th Republic Day&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thaindian.com/news-snippet/international-education-fair-2008-and-premier-schools-exhibition-opens.-4571.html&#34; title=&#34;International Education Fair 2008 and Premier Schools Exhibition Opens&#34;&gt;education exhibition at Queen Sirikit National Convention Center&lt;/a&gt;. Thaindian.com was the Web Partner for the education exhibition and we had 2 booths there, thus my presence there especially during the opening ceremony was important.

After the opening of the exhibition and getting someone to cover for me, at about 11am I headed to BarCamp. As soon as i stepped into the garden I was amazed to see so many happy campers. Registered and got my tag. In case anyone is wondering my tags were &#34;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sajalkayan.com/tag/drupal&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sajalkayan.com/category/seo&#34; title=&#34;SEO articles by Sajal&#34;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt;, SEM and monetizing&lt;/strong&gt;&#34;. Most of my time there I spend interacting with some of the other campers. Did an occasional errand or two.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2220495534/&#34; title=&#34;jfxberns : successfully converted me... by sajal kayan, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2049/2220495534_30a9c3ce34_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jfxberns : successfully converted me...&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; vspace=&#34;5&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;161&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When I entered most of the presentations were either topics I am not interested in or were in Thai language. The ones I was interested in were scheduled after lunch. I was thinking about talking about my journey from Joomla to Drupal, but I had no time(or energy) to prepare anything. After the delicious lunch, I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnberns.com/&#34; title=&#34;John Berns&#34;&gt;jfxbern&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnberns.com/2008/01/27/barcamp-bangkok-wrap-up/&#34; title=&#34;Barcamp Bangkok Wrap-Up from Jon Berns&#34;&gt;Drupal App Development with CCK and Views&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately mid-way during the session his Firefox crashed (it was running on Windoze after all!). The good side was I won a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sajalkayan/2221137392/&#34; title=&#34;Google shirt&#34;&gt;cool Google shirt&lt;/a&gt;.

At about 3pm, I left back for Queen Sirikit National Convention center to attend to my booth and take some more pics of the exhibition.Joined back for the afterparty at about 6:30pm. The after-party was fun, so many campers in a nice lil place on Sukhumvit Soi 33/1. Here I was one of the last few people standing.. Next day woke up at 8am to attend to my booths.

BarCampBangkok 2.0 is most likely to be BeachCamp, really looking forward to it. Perhaps use a long weekend and extend it into a 2/3 day event.

BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences — open, participatory workshop-events, whose content is provided by participants — often focusing on early-stage web applications, and related open source technologies, social protocols, and open data formats. The event will be bilingual, in both English and Thai.
