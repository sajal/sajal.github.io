      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please wait for a site operator to respond.

You are now chatting with &#39;Brandon&#39;

Brandon: Hi, how may I help you?

sajal: hi this is a clients account where im supposed to setup the VPS. its been almost a day since the VPS was requested.... when can i expect it to be provisioned? it still tells me &#34;You currently have 1 pending VPS web server order in our queue.&#34;

Brandon: Unfortunately it can take up to a couple of days at times. If you&#39;d like to have this expedited, please submit a ticket via &#34;Support&#34; &gt; &#34;Contact Support&#34;

sajal: wow.. couple of days.. seems like i made a mistake recommending dreamhost... let me try the support ticket... hope any issues with hosting in the future also dont take couple of days...

Brandon: Thanks, take care.

Chat session has been terminated by the site operator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Don&#39;t get it? couple of days to provision a damn VPS? I am used to getting physical dedicated servers provisioned at Softlayer in &lt; 4  hours. Amazon EC2 instances in &lt; 1 minute...

The only reason im using DreamHost is cause this is a clients project where fancy panels for domains, settings, etc would be easily user maintainable.
