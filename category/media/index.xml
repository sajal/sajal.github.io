      <title>Leading Indian news agency becomes victim of cyberterrorism</title>

      <description>&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://ians.in/&#34;&gt;Indo-Asian News Service (IANS)&lt;/a&gt; is one of India&#39;s leading news wires. Their news is available to subscribers only and among their clients are various newspapers and news websites. They are one of the fastest text news services and often among the first to break news.

Last night, their website was hacked (or to be politically correct I should say defaced or owned) allegedly by hackers based at Pakistan. These criminals did not take down the entire website, it was worse. They put in derogatory stories against India within the wire. To news websites syndicating their news, it would seem like a genuine news from their end. Here is a screenshot of their latest post today morning.

&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.sajalkayan.com/haxored.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ians Hacked&#34; width=&#34;221&#34; height=&#34;384&#34; /&gt;

At the time of writing (Feb 11th 10am or 8:30 Indian time) the IANS website is still unaccessible

Some observations about IANS
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It uses PHP&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The client side coding is very pathetically done, Very likely the backend is just as bad or worse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Their servers(at Delhi) uses &#34;TATA Communications&#34; as ISP meaning it is either self hosted or at a datacenter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;Uses windows for webservers (This is AFAIK, website is down now, so cant probe to be sure) &lt;/span&gt;correction it is on Red Hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
What ticks me off is that this is such an important site it should be much more secure. The traffic to the site may be negligable, but if at all you are a newsjunkie, it is highly likely that you read stories from IANS on a daily basis on other websites/newspapers.

Edit : 9am IST the website is back online

UPDATE : &lt;strong&gt;4:05 pm (Indian Time)&lt;/strong&gt; IANS has published the following message on their wire :-
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Subscriber,
The IANS website -- www.ians.in -- was targeted by Pakistani hackers last night.

The hackers gained entry into the site and began uploading abusive

content. This was noticed around 1 a.m. by our technical staff, who

immediately began clearing the offensive content. To prevent any damage to

the database, the site was shut down for a few hours. Meanwhile, we are

further strengthening our security systems to prevent the recurrence, as far

as possible, of any such incidents in the future.

Any inconvenience caused to subscribers is deeply regretted.

Best regards,

Partha Sarathi Mitra

C.T.O.

IANS&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some things worth noting:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There appears to be 2 attacks not 1, one around midnight-ish and one few hours later. Messages from the first attack was deleted, service resumed normally, then there was another attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If site was intentionally shut down then why no message on it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cant seem to find any reassurances that our contact details, etc are safe... Did they steal anything?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No email communication from them yet. This message was just put into the wire along with 100s of stories, very easy to miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Leading Thai Undergarment company threatnes the press</title>
      <link>http://www.sajalkayan.com/leading-thai-undergarment-company-threatnes-the-press.html</link>

      <description>I run a news.google.com published website. Recently we ran a story titled &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/thailand/5000-undergarment-workers-storm-government-house_10080116.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5000 undergarment workers storm Government House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#34;. The source of this story is National News Bureau, Public Relations Department of Thailand (Who has now pulled off the story).

The story on my site was published at August 5th, 2008 - 2:59 pm (Thai Time). At about 8:30 pm (too late to expect anyone working), I get a call on my landline &lt;strong&gt;*allegedly*&lt;/strong&gt; from the PR company who takes care of the PR for &#34;Triumph International (Thailand)&#34;, the company the news story is about. I am really a dumb ass for not making a note of her name or the name of the company she works for.

She demanded I pull off the story as it is incorrect. They have made my source (and even their source) do the same. She said that the figures and facts were incorrect. I politely asked for the correct information, but she insisted I remove the story. I tried explaining to her that simply deleting pages which exist in many places in my link structure is harmful for my site. I told her ill comply to her request by morning as all my staff have left work. At this point I thought all was well, when all of a sudden she brought out a point that this is story is wrong and that there can be legal action taken against us.

WTF!!! I said ill comply why you wanna talk about legal action?

At this point the story is still active on the site for the following reasons.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For all we know the the call was not from someone authentic. Someone was fooling with me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I haven&#39;t received any request or threat in writing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The request came in too late, beyond our office timing (9am to 5pm)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We have not received any press release or press statement from the company.Â  Even their &lt;a href=&#34;http://triumph-international.com/press/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;pressroom&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t have Thailand in the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Friendly tip : If you want to damage reputation of your competitor, call up all media outlets you can think of, pretend to be the competitor, and give them legal threats. Make sure to leave no paper trail.

Would love to see your opinions via the comments. I believe this is not an issue to be taken lightly. Should i suck up to the TPTB?

Edit1 : The original story is also &lt;a href=&#34;http://citynewsr.com/2008/08/05/5000-undergarment-workers-storm-government-house/&#34;&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;.
Edit2: Very &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bangkokbugle.com/2008/08/thai-website-threatened-with-legal.html&#34;&gt;interesting discussions&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bangkokbugle.com/&#34;&gt;Bangkok Bugle&lt;/a&gt;
